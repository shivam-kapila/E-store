                            The company was founded in 1998, spurred by what Velos called his "Initiating framework", which described his efforts as an initiate to participate in the Internet business boom during that time. In 1998, Velos left his employment as president of Ofcol & Co. and moved to Seattle. He began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become E- Store.
